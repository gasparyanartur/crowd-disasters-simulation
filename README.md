# Crowd Disasters Simulation (CDS)

**Date**: October 2022 - December 2022

This repository contains the code and report for the simulation project done for "FFR120 - Simulation of Complex Systems".
In it, we simulate the dynamics of a paniced crowd passing through a narrow corridor and analyse it using fluid dynamics.
The code for the simulation can found in *simulation.ipynb* and *forces.py*, while the data analysis is done in *analysis.ipynb* and *gif_generate.ipynb*.
While the abstract is included here, the full report is located in the *report.pdf* file.

## Abstract

Crowd crushes are a rare phenomena which result in great number of casualties. Large
crowds of people have been found to exhibit fluid-like behavior and can therefore be studied using
fluid dynamics. By simulating a crowd using the social force model, and analysing the outcome
of the results, we identify the crowd size and velocity as key metrics which strongly correlate with
casualties in the crowd, when compared to other metrics such as room width. We also define a
pseudo-Reynolds number for the crowd and find that casualties occur when this number is around
250 or larger. The findings show that room design plays a key role in the number of causalities
which occur during crowd disasters. Future work could be done with larger scale simulations in
order to analyse the fluid dynamics in more depth.
